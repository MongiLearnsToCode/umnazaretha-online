# Product Requirements Document: umNazaretha Streaming App

## 1. Introduction/Overview

**umNazaretha** is an independent progressive web app (PWA) designed to deliver a traditional linear TV-style streaming experience for congregants of the Nazareth Baptist Church of Ebuhleni (NBCE). The app streams a comprehensive range of content including church services, events, and original programming featuring talk shows, youth programs, women's and men's shows, magazine-style programs, and other mainstream television formats created around and for the church community, all delivered in a scheduled, "as-live" manner.

**Problem Statement**: NBCE congregation members need access to both church services and diverse, engaging programming that speaks to different demographics within the community (youth, women, men, families) while maintaining their spiritual foundation. Current options lack the variety and community-centered focus that addresses the full spectrum of congregational interests and needs.
